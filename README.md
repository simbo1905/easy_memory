**A strictly typed, platform-agnostic, and safe memory management system designed for high-performance and embedded applications.**

## TL;DR

**What is it?** A portable memory management system that replaces standard `malloc`/`free` with advanced capabilities like arbitrary alignment, scoped lifecycles, and fragmentation-resistant strategies.

**Why use it?** To get deterministic, safe, and efficient memory control on any architecture—from x86 servers to bare-metal microcontrollers (ARM, Xtensa, etc.)—without the overhead of an OS.

**How to use it?** `#define EASY_MEMORY_IMPLEMENTATION` in one `.c` file, then just `#include "easy_memory.h"`.

## Key Features

*   **Adaptive Performance:** Optimized for real-world usage patterns. Sequential allocations and LIFO deallocations (stack-like behavior) are detected and handled in **O(1)** time via the tail block. Complex, mixed-order patterns gracefully fallback to the efficient **O(log n)** tree search.
*   **Compiler Agnostic & Optimization Resilient:** Verified to work correctly across all optimization levels:
    *   **GCC/Clang:** `-O1` through `-O3`, `-Os`, and `-Oz`.
    *   **MSVC:** `/O1`, `/O2`, and `/Ox`.
    *   Strict compliance with **Strict Aliasing** rules ensures that aggressive compiler optimizations never break memory logic.
*   **Triple-Key LLRB Tree:** Free blocks are sorted by **Size**, **Alignment Quality** (CTZ), and **Address**. This reduces fragmentation by prioritizing blocks that *naturally* satisfy alignment requirements before splitting new memory.
*   **Flexible Alignment:** Supports per-allocation alignment requests (powers of two, up to **512 bytes**). Ideal for SIMD vectors and cache-line aligned buffers.
*   **Low Overhead:** Metadata consumes only **4 machine words** per block (16 bytes on 32-bit, 32 bytes on 64-bit).
*   **Bit-Packed Efficiency:** Alignment exponents are packed into the size field, and flags utilize pointer tagging. This results in minimal metadata overhead per block.
*   **Modular Sub-Allocators:** Designed as a foundation for specialized allocators. All sub-allocators have **zero-overhead creation** (cost equivalent to a single standard allocation).
    *   **Bump:** O(1) linear allocator (Available).
    *   *Stack / Slab:* (Coming soon).
*   **Scoped Memory:** Supports `em_create_nested` for hierarchical memory management. Freeing a parent scope instantly invalidates all children with O(1) complexity.
*   **Tail-End Scratchpad:** Instantly reserves a block at the highest memory address (**O(1)**). Ideal for temporary workspaces to prevent fragmentation of the main heap. Fully integrated with standard `em_free`.
*   **Concurrency Model:** Intentionally lock-free and single-threaded to avoid mutex overhead. Designed for **Thread-Local Storage (TLS)** patterns (one `EM` instance per thread).
*   **Safety First:**
    *   **XOR-Magic:** Headers are protected by address-dependent magic numbers to detect buffer underflows.
    *   **Strict Validation:** Runtime checks ensure integrity of the heap structure.
*   **Embedded Ready:** No `libc` dependency. Can run on bare metal (`EM_NO_MALLOC`).
*   **Extreme Portability:** Verified across a wide range of compilers, operating systems, hardware architectures, and endianness types. (See *Verified Platforms* below).
*   **Full C++ Compatibility:** Wrapped in `extern "C"` for seamless integration into C++ projects.
*   **Excellent Developer Experience:**
    *   **Intuitive API:** Consistent `em_*` naming convention.
    *   **Source-Agnostic:** A single set of functions works on static, dynamic, and nested memory.
    *   **Self-Documenting:** The codebase features encyclopedic comments explaining the *physics* and *rationale* behind every architectural decision.
    *   **Visual Debugging:** Optional `print_fancy` function provides detailed, colorized visualizations of the memory layout.

## Rigorous Validation

The system is subjected to exhaustive verification across diverse environments and configurations:

*   **Sanitizer Suite:** Verified with **ASan** (Address), **UBSan** (Undefined Behavior), and **LSan** (Leak) across multiple architectures to ensure memory integrity and zero leaks.
*   **Valgrind Memcheck:** **0 errors from 0 contexts**. Clean diagnostic logs ensure that library internals do not interfere with application-level debugging.
*   **Optimization Resilient:** Proven stability across aggressive compiler optimization levels:
    *   **GCC/Clang:** `-O1`, `-O2`, `-O3`, `-Os`, and `-Oz`.
    *   **MSVC:** `/O1`, `/O2`, and `/Ox`.
    *   Full compliance with **Strict Aliasing** rules guaranteed.
*   **Pedantic Compilation:** Strictly enforced "Warnings-as-Errors" policy (`-Werror`) using an extensive flag set:
    *   **Safety & Alignment:** `-Wshadow`, `-Wconversion`, `-Wundef`, `-Wstrict-aliasing=2`, `-Wcast-align`, `-Wpadded`.
    *   **Portability:** `-Wint-to-pointer-cast`, `-Wpointer-to-int-cast`, `-Wdouble-promotion`, `-Wpointer-arith`.
    *   **Code Integrity:** `-Wmissing-prototypes`, `-Wstrict-prototypes`, `-Wmissing-declarations`.
*   **Static Analysis:** Continuous monitoring via **MSVC Static Analysis** (x64/x86), **Clang-Tidy**, and **CodeFactor** (Grade A+).
*   **Platform Coverage:** Verified compatibility with **Windows (MSVC & MinGW)**, **Linux**, and **macOS**.

## Architecture

At its core, `easy_memory` is a hierarchical system. It abstracts complex memory management logic into a unified API, delegating actual storage strategies to specialized components.

### 1. The Core (Arena)
The backbone of the system. It handles the heavy lifting of block splitting, merging, and alignment.
*   **Origin:** This core logic is an evolution of the [**arena_c**](https://github.com/gooderfreed/arena_c) project, refined for stricter alignment support and bit-packed metadata.
*   **Adaptive Strategy:** It doesn't blindly search the tree. If you allocate sequentially, it acts as a fast O(1) bump allocator using the tail block. If you free in LIFO order (stack-like), it merges instantaneously. It only falls back to the O(log n) Tree Search when memory becomes fragmented.
*   **Triple-Key Tree:** When searching for gaps, it finds the *best* block not just by size, but by alignment quality, preserving large contiguous chunks.

### 2. Scratchpad (Lifecycle Isolation)
A mechanism to allocate a **single dedicated block** at the very end of the memory pool (highest address).

*   **Purpose:** Acts as an anchor point for temporary memory contexts. By placing a temporary sub-allocator (like `Bump` or `Nested Scope`) at the extreme end of memory, you maximize the contiguous space available for the main heap.
*   **Strict O(1) Performance:** Allocation simply reserves the tail space, and deallocation restores the previous state. No tree searches involved.
*   **Unified Lifecycle:** **No special deallocation functions required.** The system automatically detects scratch blocks within the standard `em_free()` or `em_destroy()` calls.
    *   Raw Memory: `em_alloc_scratch` → `em_free`
    *   Scratch EM: `em_create_scratch` → `em_destroy`
    *   Bump Allocator: `em_bump_create_scratch` → `em_bump_destroy`
*   **Constraint:** Only one scratch allocation is active at a time per `EM` instance.

### 3. Sub-Allocators
Specialized tools for specific allocation patterns. They are created *inside* a parent Core/Arena with zero overhead.
*   **Bump Allocator:** A linear allocator that only moves a pointer forward. Ideal for frame-based rendering or parsing where deallocation happens all at once.
*   *(Planned: Stack & Slab allocators for LIFO and fixed-size object pools).*

## Architectural Philosophy

Memory allocation strategies always involve a fundamental trade-off between three desirable properties: **cache locality**, **pointer stability**, and the ability to **resize** allocations. You can only pick two.

This library makes a deliberate architectural choice to prioritize **locality and stability**, which are often the most critical factors for high-performance systems like games, servers, and embedded applications.

![Tradeoffs](.github/assets/design_tradeoffs.jpeg)

### Principle 1: Pointers are Stable (No `realloc`)
Once memory is allocated from the system, its address will **never** change during its lifetime. This pointer stability allows you to safely store pointers to allocated objects without worrying about them becoming invalidated by a resize operation.
*   **No `realloc` Equivalent:** Consequently, the library does not provide a direct equivalent of `realloc`. Resizing a block in-place is not possible without potentially moving subsequent blocks, which would violate the stable pointer guarantee.

### Principle 2: Memory is Local (Performance by Default)
The system allocates memory sequentially from large, contiguous chunks. This dramatically improves cache performance compared to standard `malloc`, which can scatter allocations across the heap.

### Principle 3: Concurrency is Isolated (Lock-Free)
Standard allocators often use global locks to protect the heap, causing thread contention and context switching overhead. `easy_memory` contains **no internal mutexes or atomics**.

*   **The Model:** The library is designed for **Thread-Local Allocation** patterns. Each thread should own its own `EM` instance (or a dedicated nested scope).
*   **The Benefit:** Zero synchronization overhead. Allocation speed remains deterministic and blazing fast regardless of the number of active threads.
*   **Safety Note:** If multiple threads must share a single *parent* arena to create nested scopes, access to that parent must be externally synchronized. Once created, the nested arena is independent.

## Usage

### 1. Integration
Include the header and define the implementation in **one** source file.

```c
#define EASY_MEMORY_IMPLEMENTATION
// #define EM_NO_MALLOC // Uncomment for bare-metal usage
#include "easy_memory.h"
```

### Alternative Integration for Large Projects

In complex projects with intricate include hierarchies, ensuring that `EASY_MEMORY_IMPLEMENTATION` is defined in exactly one `.c` file can be challenging. An alternative approach is to compile the header file directly into its own object file.

You can achieve this by adding a specific build rule to your build system (e.g., Makefile, CMake). Here's an example using `gcc`:

```bash
# Example Makefile rule
easy_memory.o: easy_memory.h
	gcc -x c -DEASY_MEMORY_IMPLEMENTATION -c easy_memory.h -o easy_memory.o
```

This command tells the compiler to treat `easy_memory.h` as a C source file, define `EASY_MEMORY_IMPLEMENTATION`, and compile it into an object file named `easy_memory.o`. You can then link this object file with the rest of your project.

### 2. Standard Usage & Control
Basic allocation, zero-initialization, and fast resetting.

```c
// Create a 1MB memory context on the heap
EM *em = em_create(1024 * 1024);

// Standard allocation
MyObject *obj = (MyObject *)em_alloc(em, sizeof(MyObject));

// Zero-initialized allocation (like calloc)
Point *pts = (Point *)em_calloc(em, 10, sizeof(Point));

// Free individual block
em_free(obj);

// Reset the entire context in O(1)
// Marks all memory as free without releasing the underlying buffer
em_reset(em); 

em_destroy(em);
```

### 3. Custom Baseline Alignment
You can enforce a strict baseline alignment for **all** allocations within a context. Useful for systems requiring specific memory boundaries (e.g., GPU buffers).

```c
// Create context where EVERY allocation is guaranteed 64-byte alignment
EM *gpu_em = em_create_aligned(1024 * 1024, 64);

// This pointer is automatically 64-byte aligned
void *buffer = em_alloc(gpu_em, 1024);
```

### 4. Nested Scopes (Hierarchical Memory)
Create sub-pools within a parent allocator. This provides memory isolation and safe bulk deallocation.

```c
void handle_request(EM *global_em) {
    // Carve out a 64KB sub-context from the global memory
    EM *request_scope = em_create_nested(global_em, 1024 * 64);
    
    // Allocations here act independently
    char *buffer = (char *)em_alloc(request_scope, 1024);
    
    // Destroying the child instantly returns its 64KB block to the parent
    em_destroy(request_scope); 
}
```

### 5. Bump Sub-Allocator & Trimming
For high-speed temporary objects. Includes `trim` to return unused memory to the parent.

```c
void load_level_assets(EM *main_em) {
    // Reserve a large chunk (1MB) for the bump allocator
    Bump *bump = em_bump_create(main_em, 1024 * 1024);

    // ... load unknown amount of assets ...
    for (int i = 0; i < asset_count; ++i) {
        em_bump_alloc(bump, asset_size[i]);
    }

    // Optimization: Return unused memory back to main_em
    // If we only used 600KB, the remaining 424KB is freed to main_em
    em_bump_trim(bump); 
}
```

### 6. Static / Bare Metal (No Malloc)
Ideal for microcontrollers (STM32, AVR, RP2040, ESP32) or OS kernels.

```c
// Pre-allocate memory in .bss or stack
uint8_t pool[1024 * 32]; 

void main() {
    // Initialize EM over the static buffer
    // Returns NULL if the buffer is too small for metadata
    EM *em = em_create_static(pool, sizeof(pool));

    // ... use em_alloc as normal ...
}
```

## Configuration

Customize the library's behavior by defining macros **before** including `easy_memory.h`.

### Runtime Safety Policies (`EM_SAFETY_POLICY`)

Controls the balance between absolute performance and runtime resilience.

| Policy | Mode | Description | Recommended For |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | **CONTRACT** | **Design-by-Contract.** All checks are delegated to `EM_ASSERT`. Misuse leads to immediate abort (Debug) or UB (Release). | Performance-critical / Hardened Dev |
| **1** | **DEFENSIVE** | **Fault-Tolerance (Default).** Performs robust 'if' checks. Gracefully returns `NULL` or exits on API misuse. | Production / General Purpose |

> **Note:** The final behavior of **CONTRACT** mode is determined by your [Assertion Strategy](#assertion-strategy).

### Assertion Strategy

Determines how the library handles internal invariant violations.

| Macro | Effect on Failure | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **(Default)** | No-op | Assertions are compiled out. Safe for release. |
| `DEBUG` | Calls `assert()` | Standard C behavior. Aborts with file/line information. |
| `EM_ASSERT_STAYS` | Calls `assert()` | **Forces assertions to remain active** even in Release builds. |
| `EM_ASSERT_PANIC` | Calls `abort()` | Hardened release. Prevents exploitability on heap corruption without leaking debug info. |
| `EM_ASSERT_OPTIMIZE`| `__builtin_unreachable()` | **DANGER**. Uses assertions as compiler optimization hints. UB if condition is false. |
| `EM_ASSERT(cond)` | **Custom** | Define this macro to implement custom error handling (e.g., logging, infinite loop, hardware reset). Overrides all other assertion flags. |

### Memory Poisoning

Helps detect use-after-free and uninitialized memory usage.

| Macro | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **(Default)** | Disabled in Release, Enabled in `DEBUG`. |
| `EM_POISONING` | Force **ENABLE** poisoning (even in Release). Fills freed memory with `EM_POISON_BYTE`. |
| `EM_NO_POISONING` | Force **DISABLE** poisoning (even in `DEBUG`). Useful for performance profiling in debug builds. |
| `EM_POISON_BYTE` | The byte value used for poisoning (Default: `0xDD`). |

### System & Linkage

| Macro | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `EASY_MEMORY_IMPLEMENTATION` | **Required.** Expands the implementation in the current translation unit. |
| `EM_NO_MALLOC` | Disables `stdlib.h` dependency. Removes heap-based `em_create`, leaving only `em_create_static`. Essential for **Bare Metal**. |
| `EM_STATIC` | Declares all functions as `static`, limiting visibility to the current translation unit. |
| `EM_RESTRICT` | Manually define the `restrict` keyword if your compiler does not support auto-detection. |
| `EM_NO_ATTRIBUTES` | Force-disables all compiler-specific attributes (`malloc`, `alloc_size`). **Note:** This is automatically enabled when both `EASY_MEMORY_IMPLEMENTATION` and `EM_STATIC` are defined to prevent pointer provenance issues during inlining. |

### Fine-Tuning

| Macro | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `EM_DEFAULT_ALIGNMENT` | `16` | Baseline alignment for allocations (must be a power of two). |
| `EM_MIN_BUFFER_SIZE` | `16` | Minimum usable size of a split block to prevent micro-fragmentation. |
| `EM_MAGIC` | `0xDEADBEEF..` | Magic number used for block validation. Can be customized for uniqueness. |

## Limitations & Roadmap

### ⚠️ Current Limitation: Stack Usage (Recursive Algorithms)
The current implementation of the LLRB tree (insertion, deletion, and balancing) relies on **recursion**. 

*   **Impact:** While efficient and readable, deep recursion may risk a **Stack Overflow** on severely constrained embedded platforms (e.g., AVR, Cortex-M0 with tiny stacks) if memory becomes highly fragmented, leading to a deep tree structure.
*   **Mitigation:** On standard desktop/server environments or embedded systems with reasonable stack sizes, this is rarely an issue.
*   **Call for Contribution:** Switching the LLRB logic to an **iterative (loop-based)** implementation is a high-priority goal to guarantee fixed stack usage. If you enjoy algorithmic challenges and non-recursive tree traversals, **Pull Requests are highly welcome!**

### Upcoming Features
The following features are planned for future releases, prioritized by architectural importance:

- [ ] **New Sub-Allocators:**
    - **`Stack` Allocator:** A strict LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) allocator for temporary scopes, faster and lighter than nested arenas.
    - **`Slab` Allocator:** A fixed-size block pool, ideal for reducing fragmentation when allocating many identical objects.
- [ ] **Benchmark Suite:** A comprehensive set of automated benchmarks to verify performance claims against `malloc` and other allocators across different architectures.
- [ ] **Statistics & Telemetry:** Optional, configurable collection of runtime metrics (total allocated bytes, high water mark/peak usage, fragmentation index) to aid in profiling.
- [ ] **`Queue` Sub-Allocator:** A specialized FIFO (First-In-First-Out) allocator implementation (Ring Buffer strategy).
